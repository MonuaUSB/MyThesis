# Evaluation of Database Management Systems Efficiency for Web Resources

## Abstract
The final qualifying work contains **98 pages, 48 figures, and 11 tables** and consists of an **introduction, three chapters, a conclusion, a list of references, and six appendices**.

- **Introduction**: Justifies the relevance of the research topic, formulates the goal and objectives of the work.
- **Chapter 1**: Provides an overview of the subject area and existing methods for evaluating database management systems (DBMS) efficiency for web resources. Defines the main project requirements.
- **Chapter 2**: Develops a methodology for assessing DBMS performance, designs the database structure, and defines key performance indicators. A software package for testing and visualizing results is implemented.
- **Chapter 3**: Includes experimental results evaluating the efficiency of various DBMS (**MySQL, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, MongoDB**) using the proposed methodology. Performance is assessed on different data volumes, and recommendations are provided for selecting a DBMS for web resources.

**Conclusion**: Summarizes the research findings.
